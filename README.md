# Raf Blog

https://mrafsyam.github.io

This site is the platform where I write as often as possible about various topics, usually around Software Developement.

I used to blog in Blogger/Blogspot, and then on Wordpress.org and then on self-hosted Wordpress site. 

As a developer who uses git daily, why not here on Github, right?
