# Raf Blog

This site (https://mrafsyam.github.io/) is the platform where I write as often as possible about various topics, usually around Software Developement.

I used to blog in Blogger/Blogspot, and then on Wordpress.org and then on self-hosted Wordpress site. As a developer who uses git daily, why not here, right?
