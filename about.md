## Little bit about me

I graduated college with a degree in Electronics Engineering from MMU, Cyberjaya. During my final years, I spent a lot of hours learning to code, exploring my Fedora box, breaking my Raspberry Pi, cracking my Android devices, hacking neighbours' WIFI, writing applications for any IOT devices that I could lay my hands on, creating websites, building mobile apps etc. 

To be frank, I didn't know anything about Software Engineering at the time. I was just mad curious on how things work.

Three months before I graduated, Accenture accepted me as a Junior Software Engineer. A year later, Kendra Solutions took me in as a Software Engineer and I have been with them for good 5 years. Along the way, I did some side projects in the weekends and odd hours, mostly for the sake of upskilling myself. 

In Oct 2021, I joined AIA's Cyberjaya Tech Centre as a Senior Java Developer. 

## Why do I code? Why Software Engineering?

I enjoy solving technical problems. I am passionate and excited to learn new things tech. I like to teach myself new concepts. I may not know every single one of the latest technologies, but I'd like to think that given a problem, I would be able to break it down and provide workable solutions.

My work with Kendra Solutions have revolved around Payment Gateway, Payment Integration Systems and E-recharge Systems, which handles ten of thousands daily transactions. Most of the applications are built on Java, Python, Bash and MySQL, primarily focused on the backend implementation of SOAP and RESTful APIs.

## What else do I do?

Recently, I have started to pick up Flutter Mobile App developement and have since published 3 Apps both on Google Play and Apple Store. See my work at my personal site [www.kemaman.org](http://kemaman.org)

On the side, I write a blog and teach people to code. I also regularly play organized basketball and go camping.
