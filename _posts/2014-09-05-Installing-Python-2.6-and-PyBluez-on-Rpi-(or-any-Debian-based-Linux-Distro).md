My experiment on running the simple server based on Python 2.6 and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pybluez/">PyBluez</a> works well in Windows along with the App I've written. I was able to send data from the Android App and the server was able to receive the data and display it.<br /><br />Implementing native Bluetooth socket on Rpi sent me to a dead end where I could not figure out why it doesn't work and lack of resources to resolve the problem. Although packaged in within the more updated version of Python (Python 3.3), little&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/socket.html">documentations</a>&nbsp;have been made on it.<br /><br />On Rpi, the App shown that connection has been made with the server and data has been successfully sent, but none of those are indicated on the server that I ran. Weird? Yes. I have decided to try writing the server with the older Python 2.6 and PyBluez to test if it works.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Installing Python 2.6 in Linux:</span><br />1. Download Python 2.6 from <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/Python-2.6.6.tgz">here</a><br />2. Go to the containing directory (use "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cd</span>" command to navigate).<br />3. Decompress the .tar.gz by using<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">tar -xzf&nbsp;Python-2.6.6.tar.gz</span>"<br />4. Go to the decompressed folder "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cd&nbsp;Python-2.6.6</span>"<br />5. Issues these following command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;"<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">./configure</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; make<br />&nbsp; sudo make install</span>"<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Installing PyBluez in Linux:</span><br />1. Download PyBluez from <a href="https://pybluez.googlecode.com/files/PyBluez-0.18.tar.gz">here</a><br />2. Go to the containing directory<br />3. Decompress the .tar.gz by using<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">tar -xzf&nbsp;PyBluez-0.18.tar.gz</span>"<br />4. Go to the decompressed folder "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cd&nbsp;PyBluez-0.18</span>"<br />5. Still in the shell, run "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">sudo&nbsp;<span class="pln">python2.6 setup</span><span class="pun" style="color: #666600;">.</span><span class="pln">py install</span></span><span class="pln" style="font-family: Monaco, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', 'Lucida Console', monospace;">"&nbsp;</span><br /><span class="pln" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span class="pln" style="font-family: inherit;">(Note that we run the script using "python2.6" and not "python". "python" will refer to the default installed python which could be Python2.7 or Python 3 which we don't want to use for now. Issuing "python2.6" will ensure that we run our scripts using Python2.6 instead.)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Monaco, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', 'Lucida Console', monospace;"><br /></span>Update: You might get an error that says Python.h is missing.&nbsp;Python.h is a header file written in C++. It is used by gcc to build applications. You need to install a package called python-dev. This package includes header files, a static library and development tools for building Python modules. To install this package, enter: "<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">sudo apt-get install python2.6-dev" </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">targeting our Python2.6</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You might also need to install bluetooth header (bluetooth.h). Enter</span> "</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">apt-get install libbluetooth-dev".&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">After these two headers are installed, now you can proceed to installing PyBluez.<br /><br />Update: It seems that writing the server with Python2.6 and PyBluez gave me the same result. My next try will be writing the server on another language. The problem could be on Python's implementation on Bluetooth with Rpi.<br /></span>
