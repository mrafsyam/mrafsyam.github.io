1. In Linux, Tomcat can be typically installed at a few possible location such as<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>/usr/share/tomcat8<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>/var/lib/tomcat8/<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>/opt/tomcat8<br /><br />Note : At KWT server, Tomcat is installed at /var/lib/tomcat8/<br /><br /><br />2. Tomcat has a few Environment Variables<br /><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>$CATALINA_HOME : where Tomcat is installed<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>$CATALINA_BASE : same as CATALINA_HOME<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>$CATALINA_PID : location of pid file for Tomcat running process (will discuss later)<br /><br /><br />3. To start Tomcat, usually we can run : "$CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh start"<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br /><br />4. Once Tomcat is running, the pid of the Tomcat process is writen into a file which is declared in $CATALINA_PID.<br />Typically value for $CATALINA_PID is $CATALINA_BASE\bin\catalina.pid<br /><br />When you open this file, (run "less $CATALINA_BASE\bin\catalina.pid"), you will see the pid of the Tomcat process<br /><br /><br />5. You stop Tomcat process by running : "kill -kill 1239" (replace 1239 with the pid of the process)<br />This is a generic Linux's way of killing any process.<br /><br /><br />6. Typically, to stop Tomcat, you run "$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh start"<br /><div><br /><br />NOTE : To add more : Logging, folder structure, manager, host manager, multiple instance, users, server setting</div>
