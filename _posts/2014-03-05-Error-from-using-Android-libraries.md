The logcat states something in the line<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 7px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; line-height: 1.3;">Jar Mismatch Found 2 versions of android-support-v4.jar in the dependency list</span></div>It means we have two jar files, one from the project and the other one from the included library. <br />Delete the one in the current project folder (/libs). As long as the library stays included, this should be fine.<br /><br />credit : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12045568/jar-mismatch-found-2-versions-of-android-support-v4-jar-in-the-dependency-list">StackOveflow&nbsp;</a><br /><br />
