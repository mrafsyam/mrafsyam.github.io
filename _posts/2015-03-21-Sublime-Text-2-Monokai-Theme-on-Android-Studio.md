I had it changed on Windows, so I figured I'd have it change here on Kali Linux too. Here are the steps:<br /><br />Download the Sublime Monokai Theme (.zip)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from https://github.com/y3sh/Intellij-Colors-Sublime-Monokai<br /><br />Import the downloaded file. File -&gt; import settings -&gt; and select the Monokai-Sublime.jar<br /><br />Change to the Darcula theme at Settings - Appearance<br /><br />Select SublimeMonokai scheme for font at Settings - Editor - Colors and Fonts<br /><br />Select the Consolas Font at Settings - Editor - Colors and Fonts - Font and set the font size to 15<br /><br /><br />This is how it looks:<br /><br /><img height="328" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*zw2Uvn0azDl9nBR6v_Nygw.png" width="640" />
