Any changes to that file are instantly visible to applications that access it through the hard links that reference it.<br /><br /><b>Junctions</b><br /><br />A junction (also called a soft link) differs from a hard link in that it references the target directories, as opposed to a single file.<br /><br /><b>Command :</b><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">mklink /H destination-file-address target-file-address<br />mklink /J destination-folder-address target-folder-address</span></blockquote>
