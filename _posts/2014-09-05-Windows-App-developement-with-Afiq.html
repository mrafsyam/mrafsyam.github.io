Me and Afiq were in charge of developing the App for the Innovate Malaysia design competition. In short, we need to build the similar version of Android App for Windows Platform. As I have been familiarizing my self with the dark side of the phone's Bluetooth development, developing for Windows Phone becomes rather easy for me.<br /><br />Afiq started the work early as I was still busy developing the Android version. Below is one of his screenshots. Nice experience, eh? Maybe one of us will end up being a developer one day.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CAd5Q5XF2iw/UxlfKZWMfkI/AAAAAAAAAdc/Xssohsk5cwg/s1600/My+Progress+Today.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CAd5Q5XF2iw/UxlfKZWMfkI/AAAAAAAAAdc/Xssohsk5cwg/s1600/My+Progress+Today.PNG" height="180" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />
