<div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">My first encounter with Arduino was last year, when me and Ifa were working on our Embedded System's assignment. Our task was to design a Bin-to-Dec converter, with 3 7-segment displays. I didn't keep much records on the works done, but I did take this video after we unbox-ed the Arduino.</div></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/o-YLKHg2Qm8" width="420"></iframe>  </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Uno!</div>
