<b>What is Version Control?</b><br /><br />Version Control is a program that tracks changes of files over time by virtue of version or revision which is a running numbering system.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Consider this scenario :</b><br /><br />When you started you project and save it the first time, that is version #1.<br />When you worked on the project again and save it for the second time, that is version #2. And, so on.<br /><br />Version Control allow you to see the differences between each revision, when it was made and who did it. It also allow you to have a backup (you normally save your project to a remote server). Also, when you mess up, you can also easily get back to a previous working version.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M-O8ZNW9icQ/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-O8ZNW9icQ?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><br /><b>Learn the Lingo!</b><br /><br />Most version control systems have similar concepts. Lets go with Git.<br /><br /><b>Terms</b><br /><br />1. Remote Repository (repo) : The remote server which we stored our files.<br /><br />2. Local repo/Working Copy : Our local directory of files, where you make changes.<br /><br />3. Head: The latest revision in the repo.<br /><br />4. Origin : The "main" location of the files. Typically, on remote repo. But can also be on your computer.<br /><br /><br /><b>Commands</b><br /><br />1. git init : Make the current directory as a local repo. (local repo is the origin. no remote repo linked at this point)<br /><br />2. git add : Put files into local repo for the first time, i.e. begin tracking it with Version Control.<br />This is called "<b>staging</b>" or put the file on "<b>stage</b>".<br /><br />3. git clone : Clone a remote repo to a local directory with origin pointing to the remote repo.<br />Doesn't require git init. Also called checkout code from remote repo.<br /><br />4. git status : Show files that are tracked in local repo.<br />Typically, will show files that are newly added, modified or untracked files.<br /><br />5. git log : Show log of changes with their revision.<br /><br />6. git revert : Revert local repo to previous revision state.<br /><br />7. git commit : Commit all changes (<b>or all files in staging</b>) to local repo.<br /><br />8. git push : Push your last commit to origin (typically, remote repo).<br />Also called checkin your code to remote repo.<br /><br />9. git pull : Keep your local repo up to date with remote repo aka get updates from remote repo.<br />Obviously, also called update or sync.<br /><br />10. git diff : view the differences between current codes (if changes are made) and the previous revision.<br /><br />11. git merge : apply the changes from one file to another.<br />Typically, when you try to push a file, another developer has also pushed for some changes on the file after your last update with remote repo (so you haven't got his changes yet)<br /><br />12. git rm : remove the file from tracking.<br />&nbsp;After commited, the file then becomes "untracked" if you use "git status".<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HVsySz-h9r4/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVsySz-h9r4?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sUoiw9vzEoY/WHGjpFjMPqI/AAAAAAAABqo/vgcytXuz9jIvY3vA52K8uu1a0CMjgN94gCLcB/s1600/Capturegit.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="440" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sUoiw9vzEoY/WHGjpFjMPqI/AAAAAAAABqo/vgcytXuz9jIvY3vA52K8uu1a0CMjgN94gCLcB/s640/Capturegit.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br />
