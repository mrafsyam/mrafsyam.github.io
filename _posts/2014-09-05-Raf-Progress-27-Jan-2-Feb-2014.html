Date: 27 Jan-2 Feb 2014<br /><br />I went back to Terengganu for a week with the hope to do some writing and home cleanups after the recent flood. However, a bad fever caught me and I spent literally 5 days resting. The family outing during the following weekend topped it up and I was officially having a week work-free :D<br /><br />Nevertheless, I did went through some more related papers to help me to get going with the thesis.<br /><br />Objectives (what did you planned to do?):<br />1. Writing/Revising for the 2nd draft of Literature Review.<br />2. Begin writing the introduction part of the thesis<br />3. App should be able to send photo to another phone via the same App<br />4. Write Steganography encoding using libpng (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/581298/PNG-Image-Steganography-with-libpng).<br /><br />Efforts done (what did you do?):<br />1. Fever. Not much to consider them efforts at all.<br /><br />Objective for next week:<br />Continue from last week.<br />1. Writing/Revising for the 2nd draft of Literature Review.<br />2.
