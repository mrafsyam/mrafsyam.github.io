Another project not even started (don't talk about finishing it here).<br /><br />This is supposed to be a forum where MMU Faculty of Engineering (FOE) students can share stuff (tutorial answers, past assignment resources etc). We do have a facebook group for such function, but over the time things will get real disorganized and being me, I just can't stand that.<br /><br />Here is the MMU FOE students FB group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/178184952269/"><b>link</b></a><br /><br />The group was orignally has 10 members which were all my former classmates, but now it's consistently growing over these 3 years. Hopefully it will stand benificial to them.<br /><br />MMU IEEE Student Branch approached me with the idea of continuing this project under their name. I am willing to, but not by myself, no. If there are some people who are willing to spend times on this, I'd be willing to help out.
