I am (no offence to Alex) always being picked to follow my boss around for meetings and other out-of-office works, which normally required me to be there at the office very early in the morning. He basically introduced me to the Johara Pagi Era session, saying he listens to them every day. It's aired around 715 AM in the morning on ERA.fm.<br /><br />A good laugh to start a day.<br /><br />They actually have a page archiving all their shows. Just perfect :D<br /><br /><a href="http://podcast.ampradio.net/era/">Johara Pagi Era Session on ERA.fm</a>
