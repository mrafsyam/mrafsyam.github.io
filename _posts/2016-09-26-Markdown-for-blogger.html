Well, it seems like I have to get familiar with markdown since my company's WIKI is written using it.<br /><br />Here's one useful tool :&nbsp;<a href="https://stackedit.io/editor">StackEdit</a><br /><br />I would like to re-write all posts from this blog by using markdown. Still waiting for official support from Blogger but it does not seem it's going to happen real soon.<br /><br />Any ideas?
