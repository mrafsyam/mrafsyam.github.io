Instead, lets permanently authenticating with Git repositories using username and password.<br />Run following command to enable credential caching:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">$ git config credential.helper store</blockquote><br />Afterwards, make some changes, commit and try with git push.<br /><br />No more relogin.
