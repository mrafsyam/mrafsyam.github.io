I need to remind myself again and again about these two things. The concept is not hard to understand, but often it's easy to get confused.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Motivation - What drives us to put efforts in developing the proposed project?</span><br /><ul><li>What are the problems/limitations/situation in relation to the current existing solutions?</li><li>Why such problems/limitations/situation are of importance, that it requires 'solving'? Narrow it down into a specific scope..</li></ul><div><span style="font-size: large;">Novelty - What is the uniqueness of the proposed project?</span></div><div><ul><li>What are the 'new stuff' that we are proposing via the project?&nbsp;</li><li>How are they different from the current existing solutions? (must highlight how the existing solutions do not have the 'new stuff' that we are proposing)</li><li>Why are they importance? Why they are needed? Explain with help of scenarios within the aforementioned scope, go into details as necessary.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>
