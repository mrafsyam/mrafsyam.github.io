Had a nice informal interview (more like a meetup, really) with one of the partners of Kendra Solutions (https://kendra-solutions.com), Andreas. They work on a payment exchange/gateaway system for Telco companies called Kendra Exchange System. Andreas introduced me to some tools that the company are using for the development of their system and MySQL Cluster is one of them.<br /><br />Gotta learn what it is.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnWItDTZL2c" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MP_GbMLOqOk" width="560"></iframe>
