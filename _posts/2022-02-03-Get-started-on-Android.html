Although the Android Developer site is pretty comprehensive, I found it is also useful for me to learn Android Developement via videos. TheNewBoston is hands down one of the best tutorial sites for technical knowledge, mainly for programming languages such as C, C++, Java and a couple more. If you haven't gone through his video, do check them <a href="http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=6">here</a>.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I still think that some important aspects of Android development are best exemplified on <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/index.html">Android Developer site</a>&nbsp;and you will find you'll be doing frequent visit to the site. Bookmark it! :-)<br /><br />You also need to know the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html">Android API</a> site. These explain all available APIs and it will be useful for you in order to understand each and every objects and their methods of within Android's Java. If you use Eclipse, right clicking on the methods will redirect you to this site within the editor itself.
